<p>You can build "easy" on top of "simple", but it's hard to do the reverse.<br>

Biff speeds up web development by providing as much functionality as possible
out-of-the-box while making it easy to swap out, modify, or remove parts as
your project grows. It prioritizes small-to-medium sized projects.

The goal is to provide the benefits of a web framework without sacrificing the
simplicity that makes Clojure great.

## About

Biff is developed by myself, [Jacob O'Bryant](https://tfos.co). I use it for all my web apps, primarily
[Yakread](https://yakread.com/) and [The Sample](https://thesample.ai/), each of which has
15k-20k lines of code.

If you'd like to support Biff, you can [sponsor me](https://github.com/sponsors/jacobobryant/).
I also do [consulting](https://biffweb.com/consulting) for businesses that are
interested in using Biff.
